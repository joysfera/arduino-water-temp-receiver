# arduino-water-temp-receiver
Arduino library for receiving temperature sent by commercial water pool
temperature sensor KW9043 and compatible ones.
It seems that another supported temperature sensor is from Hyundai WSC.
There are many more similar ones, I believe. Just try it out.

New version of the library handles negative temperatures properly
and actually offers an example in the Arduino IDE.

Enjoy,
